        This project examines the durability of bamboo as a sustainable material for modern construction. 
        By testing the strength of various bamboo species and comparing their ability to withstand pressure, tension,
        and shear, we aim to understand how they stand out from traditional materials such as wood, brick, and concrete. 
        The findings suggest that bamboo is much stronger than these materials, making it a viable option for structural 
        applications. Additionally, this project highlights successful construction projects made of a bamboo, providing 
        further evidence to support the theory that bamboo can meet essential strength standards while contributing to 
        reduced carbon emissions in the construction industry.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
      <P class="ex1">
        
        <pre>
       In recent years, bamboo has emerged as a versatile and sustainable building material due to its exponential growth,
       strength, and flexibility. Its primary applications range from constructing walls and roofs to scaffolding, which is
       important in regions prone to earthquakes. Although bamboo offers eco-friendliness, affordability and durability,
       challenges like susceptibility to pests and fungi highlight the need for proper maintenance. This article delves into
       the properties, advantages, and limitations of bamboo, giving evidence to its potential to transform modern construction
       in an environmentally sustainable manner.

<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
       1. <u>Tensile strength</u>
       Bamboo's fiber composition consists of cell walls that are rich in long, aligned cellulose fibres that provide significant
       resistance to pulling forces, making them strong in tension. Recent studies <a href="https://www.guaduabamboo.com/blog/mechanical-properties-of-bamboo" target="_blank">(Guadua Bamboo, n.d.)</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/2043-6262/15/4/567" target="_blank">(Sánchez et al., 2019)</a>
       show that their tensile strength ranges between 100-400 MPa, which is significantly higher than most construction-grade timbers. 
      
      2. <u>Compressive strength</u>
      Bamboo's ability to withstand being squashed or compressed typically ranges between 40 and 80 MegaPascals,<a href="https://www.guaduabamboo.com/blog/mechanical-properties-of-bamboo" target="_blank">(Guadua Bamboo, n.d.)</a> 
      depending on the species and conditions. This strength is much higher than most types of wood, which makes bamboo an excellent
      choice for load-bearing applications.(eg gas turbines, concrete mixtures and rope conveyers)
      
      However, compressive strength can vary due to factors such as: 
      - Moisture content: A strong bamboo usually has lower moisture content
      - Age: A mature bamboo (around 3-5 years) tends to have higher compressive strength. 
      -Species: Different types of species can have different compressive strength, some might have larger compressive strength, and some lower.

     3. <u>Elastic modulus</u>
      The bending modulus of elasticity of bamboo refers to the stiffness or resistance to deformation when a bending force is applied. According to <a href="https://www.materialspalette.org/bamboo/" target="_blank">Material Palette (n.d.)</a>
      the modulus of elasticity in bending can reach up to 20 GigaPascals, depending on the species and moisture content. This provides further evidence on why 
      the usage of bamboos are ideal for building beams, roofing frameworks, and flooring panels. It has a great strength-to-weight performance, which is much better
      than traditional hardwoods.

      4. <u>Density</u>
      Common bamboo species like Moso and Gadua have densities of approximately 500-800 kg/m³ according to <a href="https://kg-m3.com/material/bamboo" target="_blank">Bamboo density</a>
      which is comparable to lightweight woods but less dense than concrete (2,400 kg/m³) or steel (7850 kg/m³). Bamboos have low density, making them the ideal choice for construction where  weight
      reduction is crucial especially for scaffolding and creating lightweight roof structures. <a href="https://iarjset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IARJSET.2019.6906.pdf"_blank">IARJSET,(2019)</a>
